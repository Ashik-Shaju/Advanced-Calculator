# Advanced Calculator

## Overview

This is an advanced calculator program built in Python that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. The program features a user-friendly interface that supports various commands to clear inputs, restart the calculator, or exit the program.

## Features

- **Basic Operations**: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.
- **Input Flexibility**: Enter commands to clear inputs or restart the calculator.
- **Dynamic Result Usage**: Option to use the result of the last calculation in subsequent operations.
- **Error Handling**: Validates inputs to ensure they are numbers, providing user-friendly error messages.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.

### How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/advanced-calculator.git
   cd advanced-calculator
   ```

2. **Run the Program**:
   Open your terminal and execute:
   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```

3. **Follow the Prompts**: 
   - Enter numbers when prompted.
   - Choose an operation (+, -, *, /, %).
   - After seeing the result, you can choose to use it in the next calculation, go back to the operation step, restart the calculator, or exit.

### Commands

- **C**: Clear the current input and return to the first step.
- **CC**: Restart the entire calculator session.
- **Y**: Use the result of the last calculation as the first number for the next operation.
- **N**: Exit the program.

## Example Usage

1. Enter `10` when prompted for the first number.
2. Choose `+` as the operation.
3. Enter `5` as the second number.
4. The program will display the result: `10 + 5 = 15`.
5. You can choose to use the result in the next calculation by entering `Y`, or restart with `CC`, etc.

## Error Handling

The program ensures that:
- Non-numeric inputs are handled gracefully with prompts for valid numbers.
- Division by zero is explicitly checked and handled.
